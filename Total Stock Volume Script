Create a script that will loop through all the stocks for one year and output the following information:
  The total stock volume of the stock


Sub StockMarketTest():

    For Each ws In Worksheets
    
        Dim WorksheetName As String
        
        'Set a name for the worksheet
        WorksheetName = ws.Name
        
              
                'Determine the stock volume and print onto the summary table
                ws.Cells(Ticker, 12).Value = WorksheetFunction.Sum(Range(ws.Cells(j, 7), ws.Cells(i, 7)))
                
            
       'Create a summary table header for the listed items
     
        ws.Cells(1, 12).Value = "Total Stock Volume"

  
            
    Next ws
        
End Sub
